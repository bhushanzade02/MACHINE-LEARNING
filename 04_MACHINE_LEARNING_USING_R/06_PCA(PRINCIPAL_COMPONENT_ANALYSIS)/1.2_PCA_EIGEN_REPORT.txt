Objective:
Compare the results of our custom PCA implementation (using EIGEN DECOMPOSITION) 
with Râ€™s built-in princomp() function on the USArrests dataset.

Introduction:

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to the USArrests dataset to reduce the dimensionality of the data and extract key components. 

PCA was performed using two methods:
1.Custom PCA function (using eigenvalue decomposition).
2.princomp() function (built-in R function).


Loadings Comparison:
The first component (Comp.1) in both methods strongly correlates with Murder and Assault, 
indicating it captures the variance from these two variables.
The second component (Comp.2) primarily reflects Rape in the custom PCA, 
while princomp() includes UrbanPop in the second and third components.

Scores Comparison:
The scores for both methods show a similar pattern of variance,
 with the first component (Comp.1) dominating the explained variance.
Although the numerical values for the scores differ slightly between the methods,
 they reflect similar projections of the states onto the principal components.

Conclusion:
Both the Custom PCA and princomp() methods provide similar insights into the data,
 with slight differences in the scaling of scores and the distribution of variance across components.
 The results confirm that the custom PCA implementation is consistent with the standard PCA approach.
