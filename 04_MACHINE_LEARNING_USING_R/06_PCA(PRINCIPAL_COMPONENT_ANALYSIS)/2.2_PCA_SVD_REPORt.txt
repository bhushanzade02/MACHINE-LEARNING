Objective:
Compare the results of our custom PCA implementation (using SVD) 
with Râ€™s built-in princomp() function on the USArrests dataset.


Observation:
The loading values are identical in magnitude but differ by a sign (negative vs positive).
In PCA, sign differences are expected and mathematically valid 
because eigenvectors are unique only up to sign.

Proportion of Variance:
The built-in princomp() output shows that each principal component 
explains 25% of the total variance, as expected for a 4-variable, standardized dataset.

Correctness:
Our custom PCA implementation produces correct principal components that 
match the built-in results after accounting for possible sign flips.


Conclusion:
The custom PCA function (using SVD) is correct.
It behaves consistently with princomp() on a standard dataset (USArrests).
Minor differences in signs do not affect the interpretation of principal components
