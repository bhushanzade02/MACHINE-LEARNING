Title: EDA and Linear Regression Analysis of the Anscombe Quartet
Objective:
To explore the Anscombe Quartet dataset, perform EDA, and analyze linear regression models.

Summary Statistics:
Mean of x1: 9.0, Mean of y1: 7.5
Variance of x1: 11.0, Variance of y1: 4.1
Correlation between x1 and y1: 0.82
(Similar statistics for all four datasets)

Key Visual Observations:
Dataset 1: Shows a linear relationship.
Dataset 2: A clear non-linear pattern is observed.
Dataset 3: Contains a single influential outlier.
Dataset 4: Regression line is driven by a single vertical outlier.

Conclusions:
Despite identical summary statistics, the datasets reveal distinct patterns when visualized, underscoring the importance of visualization in data analysis.
